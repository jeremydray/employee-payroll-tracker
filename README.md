## **1.    Introduction**

The goal of this project was to provide the user input functionality in order display a provided Employee's first and last name and their given salary into a structured table. The user also has the option to add as few or many users as desired. There is also a calculation to take the average of the salaries in the console, which re-calculates in the event another employee is added after the initial calculation. Finally, the ability to select a random employee for a drawing was also added and can be viewed in the console.
